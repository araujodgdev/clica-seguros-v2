# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds an interactive car insurance quote simulation flow within the existing CTA section. Users will input their personal information (name, email) and license plate to initiate a multi-step quote process with mocked data, culminating in a redirect to a new page displaying insurance offer cards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a potential customer visiting the landing page, I want to input my personal details and license plate to start a quote simulation, so that I can experience the insurance quotation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the CTA section THEN the system SHALL display a quote simulation form with name, email, and license plate input fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid information in all fields THEN the system SHALL enable the quote initiation button
3. WHEN a user enters invalid information THEN the system SHALL display field-specific validation feedback and disable the quote button
4. WHEN a user submits the form with valid inputs THEN the system SHALL proceed to the car details confirmation step

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who has submitted my initial information, I want to confirm the details of my car that were retrieved from my license plate, so that I can ensure the quote is accurate for my vehicle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initial form is submitted THEN the system SHALL simulate retrieving car details based on the license plate
2. WHEN car details are retrieved THEN the system SHALL display mocked vehicle information including make, model, year, and other relevant details
3. WHEN car details are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a confirmation button to proceed with these details
4. WHEN a user confirms the car details THEN the system SHALL initiate the quote loading process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who has confirmed my car details, I want to see a realistic loading process while my quote is being generated, so that I understand the system is working to find the best options for me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN car details are confirmed THEN the system SHALL display a loading state with progress indicators
2. WHEN in loading state THEN the system SHALL show messaging about finding the best insurance options
3. WHEN loading completes after 3-5 seconds THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to a new page with insurance offers
4. IF there are any simulated errors THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messaging with retry options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who completes the quote process, I want to be redirected to a dedicated page showing multiple insurance offers, so that I can compare different options and select the best one for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the loading process completes THEN the system SHALL redirect to a new page (/cotacao or similar route)
2. WHEN on the offers page THEN the system SHALL display multiple insurance offer cards with general information
3. WHEN viewing offer cards THEN each card SHALL show key details like monthly premium, coverage highlights, and insurer name
4. WHEN a user clicks on an offer card THEN the system SHALL navigate to a detailed page for that specific insurance offer

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the simulation, I want smooth animations and responsive design, so that the experience feels modern and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transitioning between simulation steps THEN the system SHALL use smooth animations consistent with the site's design system
2. WHEN displaying on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality and readability
3. WHEN loading or processing THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators with brand-consistent styling
4. WHEN displaying forms and confirmations THEN the system SHALL use the existing glassmorphism and design tokens from the current CTA section

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the simulation to feel integrated with the existing page design, so that it appears as a natural extension of the current CTA section rather than a separate component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulation form is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the current CTA section's visual hierarchy and styling
2. WHEN transitioning between steps THEN the system SHALL preserve the section's background and layout structure
3. WHEN showing the simulation THEN the system SHALL use consistent typography, colors, and spacing with the existing design system
4. IF the user has not interacted with the simulation THEN the system SHALL display the original CTA content as fallback
